    <h1> WHAT IS OVERFISHING? </h1>
  </div>
    <p>Overfishing in the Pacific has been a problem for many years and is becoming an increasingly bad situation. What happens is that fishing industries use 
      fishing nets with massive weights dragging it across the ocean for profit. Of course this process is very efficient compared to say spearfishing but the 
      environmental damages this has caused is unimaginable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor, sea beds have been ruined, seaweed, kelp and mollusks have been demolished and ripped from the ground. In the water itself, 
      not just the fish people want to catch but creatures such as sharks and many other fish are caught up in the net and then killed because they are 
      considered “useless” to the greedy fishermen. 
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Overfishing_page/overfishing_article_2.jpg">
    <p>
      The most common fish that is being overfished in the pacific ocean is tuna. Many different types of tuna exist, however, no matter the species, 
      their meat is considered to be nutrient and protein rich and filled with omega-3, the key ingredient to make cell walls in the human body and keeping 
      the blood healthy. So the meat is nutrient rich, but it is also very tasty. Tuna can be found in cans, on sushi or eaten raw, it can be gourmet or cheap, 
      no matter the way it's eaten, it is a very vercitile and tasty food item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to this chaotic overfishing crisis, the amount of tuna in the sea has drastically decreased within the past 50 years. According 
      to multiple sources, the majestic Pacific Blue Fin Tuna population had dropped 97% in 2016 and was in a dire situation. 
      In 2014, there was a measure taken for the population of blue fin tuna, there were an estimated 26,000 tons in the sea which
      on its own is not a lot. The same measure was taken in 2016, there was only an estimated population of about 9,000-16,000 
      tons left in the sea. Due to this low percentage, these fish became harder to find, harder 
      to eat and almost extinct.

<div class="about"> 
  <div class="article">
  <p> Of course, tuna is not the only fish involved with overfishing. The most common way most overfishing occurs is because 
    of giant fishing nets, these stretch over hundereds of metres and is weighed down to the sea bed. The enormity means fish
     other than the desired speices are captured as well as the previously stated demolishing of the sea bed. These other organisms
     usually die before even getting out of the net to then be thrown overboard by the fishermen, left in the ocean to rot. This has 
     made so many other speices such as sharks, whales, dolphins, rare coral and turtles become close to extinction.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why doesn't anyone do anything about this overfishing catastrophe? Well thats because there is massive funding given to these
  fisheries. Every year, billions of dollars are spent investing in fisheries and aquaculture. It is estimated that one fishing 
  net of fish is around $3 million US dollars in the states. This means fishing is a very profitable investment for many who have no other income sources. 
  As a result, the greed for fish has drastically increased and ocean ecosystems cannot survive. In a statistic given from WWF, illegal, 
  unregulated fishing criminals earn an estimated $36.4 billion dollars a year.
 </p>

<p> 
  This fish isn't used for any other purpose but to be consumed by the 3 billion people who rely on fish as their main 
  source of protein. The common term for these people is a pescetarians. Overfishing allows more of these people to get 
  as much fish as they want without even realising the environmental consequences. In some developing areas, thousands of 
  fishing boats set sea every day in search of food, whilst in some developed areas, massive hauls of fish are taken right from 
  the nets. There are so many people in the world who rely on our aquatic protein that this problem cannot be stopped until we 
  as a human race find another sustainable food source other than fish.

      <h1> LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES </h1>
    </div>
    <p> 
      Greenpeace has stated that overfishing is causing serious climate change issues in temperature, this is because 
      although fish may not seem like a climate change miracle, they can do a lot more than people suspect. Carbon 
      sequestration is the process of isolating the carbon atoms into the ocean and into the depths of the sea, the 
      cean was able to hide away an estimated 38,000 gigatonnes (38,000,000,000 tonnes of carbon) of carbon each year. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that fish populations are decreasing the most they have ever done, this statistic is starting to change to a 
      lower amount increasing the amount of carbon dioxide that floats in our atmosphere.  Results of this would be i
      ncreases in air pollution, hotter temperatures and acidification of the waters leading to more horrors in the ocean 
      such as coral bleaching and destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The predator-prey relationship is a basic concept, in this case, the bigger fish eats the smaller fish, then the 
      bigger, bigger fish eats the bigger fish and so on. Now that fish like tuna have been depopuliated, the fish that 
      eat those tuna have also started to die out. Each ecosystem has an orderly food web built over centuries of adaptation 
      and survival instincts, they are strict so if even one piece falls out of the food web, then every other living being 
      involved will suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in recent years there has been a decline in plankton, this has lead to few whale shark 
      corpses found at sea whilst the living ones became aggressive for food and even attacked a scuba diver. Effects similar 
      to these is being seen across the ocean waters by the species affected by the decline in fish in general.

  <h1> SOLUTIONS TO OVERFISHING </h1>
</div>
  <p>Overfishing clearly has some of the most simplistic solutions, stop overhauling fish, start sustainably fishing 
    and/or make sustainable fish farms. The problem is, most overfishing occurs because of making large profits (
      as previously stated), so if governments around the world endorse strict laws on fishing limits with harsh consequences 
      set in place, potentially overfishing could be reduced by a great amount. There will always be some who will continue 
      to haul in way too much fish, but how we deal with those people will influence how others fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next best solution is sustainable fish farms. If we are able to set up multiple farms in many areas where we can 
    control water quality, we can drastically increase the aquaculture business and drastically reduce overfishing! 
    This becomes problematic at some point because there is not enough research done on perfect fish farming 
    climate and environments. If everyone is to thrive off this solution, then we will need to 
    do a lot more research and have a lot of time ovefishing. Fish will need to reproduce at a slow 
    rate to become sustainable, so this is not a fast process by any means.
  </p>
  <img src="../images/Overfishing_page/SustainableFishFarm.jpeg">
  <p>
    Solution number three is arguably the most impactful one of all, raising awareness for the future generations. Teenagers, 
    children, these will be the people of which take our places in the future, so it is only right for them to understand 
    the problem at hand so they have time to solve it themselves. We need to encourage them to think and act sustainably so 
    they can be engaged and possibly come up with the most revolutionary solution no one else could.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solution Number four, reducing food waste in homes. The only reason fishing is so profitable is because there is a high 
    demand for fish! People eat it so much that fish makes up 20% of the worlds animal protein source. Reducing food waste 
    isn't very hard when you think about it, freezing fish and cooking less fish, two ways you instantly reduce food waste. 
    We as humans just need to be smart with how we store and cook fish, by reducing the amount of fish we consume, this will 
    reduce the amount of fish needed to be caught.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving overfishing is a somewhat simplistic concept, stop overhauling fish, start living sustainably with fish. If people 
    can prioritise the environment over their own profits or consumption, this problem we face should become easier to deal with.
