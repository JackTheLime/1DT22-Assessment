    <h1> WHAT ARE OIL SPILLS? </h1>
  </div>
    <p>An oil spill can be defined as either a spill or release of oil into our ocean. Oil spills release a substance 
        called petroleum hydrocarbons into the ocean. Many incidents of spilt oil have occured in the last 100 years ever s
        ince oil became the main energy source around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        These incidents are acknowledged by the governments around the world as “environmental havoc for the wild life 
        involved in the area of the spills”. The unfortunate thing is that oil spills aren't uncommon, in countries such 
        as the United States where they drill oil all of the time. Most of these spills are small like bit bit of a leak when fueling 
        boats but the large oil spills cause effects that may last for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, oil is drilled by huge rigs that have been placed in a specific area. This area is found by ships using sonic sound 
      technology to find oil pockets in the sea. Rigs are then constructed and then drill down large depths to extract the oil, 
      almost like dipping a bucket into a very deep well to grab water, it is a similar concept. There are different types of these 
      rigs, but in this article, the semisubmersibles will be discuessed because they are probably one of two main sources of oil pollution. 
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Oil_Spills_Page/semisubmersable_rig.jpg">
    <p>
      Although these rigs are very efficient and effective when it comes to drilling oil from underground deposits, they sometimes 
      have their faults. Oil spills have occured many times because of problems such as pressure overloads, small leaks, pipe failures, etc. 
      These problems have caused catastrophes across our beautiful oceans and there are many famous examples of these spills.

      <h1> EXAMPLES OF OIL SPILLS </h1>
    </div>
  <p> Famous examples of oil spills include The Ixtoc 1 in 1979, The Atlantic Empress in 1979 as well, but the largest ever 
    accidental oil spill was off the gulf of Mexico called Deepwater Horizon in 2010. 
 </p>
 <p>
  This one incident caused an estimated total of 210 million gallons of oil was spilt with a two day explosion causing 
  environmental destruction across the coast of the US and the death of 11 men. The operation was to have a well to tap oil 
  drill that once filled, would be plugged with three concrete plugs and would be taken away by tanker ships. It was originally 
  built in 2001 and in September 2009, got the world record for the deepest oil well ever drilled. 
<p> 
  The accident occured on the 20th April 2010,There are theories to what happened, according to various sources, there were four possible causes;  
  dodgy concrete containing the oil, pressure test misinterpreted, the leak itself was not spotted soon enough and a valve 
  failure with the pipe connecting the oil to the concrete tubing. The real reason was due to a build up of natural gasses 
  within one of the concrete storage plugs. This resulted in an overwhelming pressure built up and should have been noticed. Due to technology 
  failure, the pressure was misread and it resulted in a blowout spilling oil everywhere with machinery sparking causing the explosions. 
</p>
<img src="../images/Oil_Spills_Page/deepwater_horizon.jpeg">
  <p> 
  As shown above, huge boats came to battle the blaze by using water from the gulf. However, due to the massive amount of oil, 
  the fire kept buring continously being fuelled and never able to be put out. The flame stayed a light for two whole days only 
  for the rig to sink and continuously approximately 1,000 barrels of oil into the sea everyday.
</p>
<p>
  Over the next two years, there were clean up crews lead primarily by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) 
  entering the spillage every day trying to contain the spill as best as possible yet even with all this effort, 
  deepwater horizon was declared to still be leaking oil. 
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, there are still beaches and coastal waters 
  polluted by the oil but the situation has been under the control of the US government and oil industries. 
  Not willingly, each party agreed there needed to be more done about the clean up, so over the past 9 
  years, more than 20% of the oil has been recovered. Unfortunately, the sunken rig is still leaking oil at a fast rate 
  to this day.

      <h1> LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES </h1>
    </div>
    <p> 
      The environmental damages these spill cause include black outs of kilometers of water, staining of bird feathers and 
      the mutation of fish and the generations that followed. Once the sea is covered in oil, the side effects is the total 
      wipeout of natural plankton that floats amongst the sea. This leads to smaller fish also dying due to starvation and/or 
      oil contamination. the reason there is no staining of say coral reefs or ocean beds is because oil as a product is lighter 
      than water meaning it floats on the surface. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the oil sitting above the water, when birds fly down to grab food, they are dyed in oil. The result changes 
      the texture of the feathers and causes there insulation abilities to fail, this then leads to hypothermia, difficulty 
      flying and inferior vision essentially killing the bird.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Oil_Spills_Page/oil_covered_bird.jpeg">
    <p>
      The most significant environmental effects of oil spills is the mutation of fish and the later generations that come. 
      According to an article about Deepwater Horizon written by “The Week,” fish in the gulf before the oil spill had only a 
      tenth of a 1 percent chance of getting skin lesions and sores. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years later, the statistic changed to a 4-5% chance of getting these mutations. When in their eggs, some baby 
      tuna have discovered to be born with deformities such as one eye, missing flaps on gills or the worst of all, fish
       without a dorsal fin. These mutations are not just happening to fish, but also other sea life such as 
       crab and shrimp. For example, scary sights have been seen by fishermen finding eyeless fish, clawless crabs, tumours on 
       a shrimps head, soft shelled crabs when they are supposed to be very sturdy and hard, and sometimes it has effected these marine creatures 
       hugely.
    </p>
    <p>
      These deformities and mutations unfortunately didn't come directly from oil pollution, but also the clean up chemicals 
      used. Around 2 million gallons (9,092,180 Litres) of chemical dispersants were used to shrink the oil particles and have
       the ability to mix with water. Although it cleaned up one problem, these chemicals caused another. The residue left by 
       these chemicals infiltrate the immune system of living organisms and mutate the genetic source code in terrible ways.

  <h1> SOLUTIONS TO OVERFISHING </h1>
</div>
  <p>Overfishing clearly has some of the most simplistic solutions, stop overhauling fish, start sustainably fishing 
    and/or make sustainable fish farms. The problem is, most overfishing occurs because of making large profits (
      as previously stated), so if governments around the world endorse strict laws on fishing limits with harsh consequences 
      set in place, potentially overfishing could be reduced by a great amount. There will always be some who will continue 
      to haul in way too much fish, but how we deal with those people will influence how others fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next best solution is sustainable fish farms. If we are able to set up multiple farms in many areas where we can 
    control water quality, we can drastically increase the aquaculture business and drastically reduce overfishing! 
    This becomes problematic at some point because there is not enough research done on perfect fish farming 
    climate and environments. If everyone is to thrive off this solution, then we will need to 
    do a lot more research and have a lot of time ovefishing. Fish will need to reproduce at a slow 
    rate to become sustainable, so this is not a fast process by any means.
  </p>
  <img src="../images/Overfishing_page/SustainableFishFarm.jpeg">
  <p>
    Solution number three is arguably the most impactful one of all, raising awareness for the future generations. Teenagers, 
    children, these will be the people of which take our places in the future, so it is only right for them to understand 
    the problem at hand so they have time to solve it themselves. We need to encourage them to think and act sustainably so 
    they can be engaged and possibly come up with the most revolutionary solution no one else could.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solution Number four, reducing food waste in homes. The only reason fishing is so profitable is because there is a high 
    demand for fish! People eat it so much that fish makes up 20% of the worlds animal protein source. Reducing food waste 
    isn't very hard when you think about it, freezing fish and cooking less fish, two ways you instantly reduce food waste. 
    We as humans just need to be smart with how we store and cook fish, by reducing the amount of fish we consume, this will 
    reduce the amount of fish needed to be caught.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving overfishing is a somewhat simplistic concept, stop overhauling fish, start living sustainably with fish. If people 
    can prioritise the environment over their own profits or consumption, this problem we face should become easier to deal with.
